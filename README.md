# Spam-SMS-Detection
#In this project, a machine learning model was developed to classify emails as 'Spam' or 'Not Spam'. Text preprocessing methods like tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization were used. Algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM were implemented and compared to find the best-performing model.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, NLP

Goal: Automatically detect and filter out spam emails.

Key Skills: Text Classification, Model Tuning, Precision-Recall Analysis
